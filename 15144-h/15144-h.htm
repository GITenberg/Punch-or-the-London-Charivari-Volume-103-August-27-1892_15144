    <h2>TWO-PENN'ORTH OF THEOSOPHY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Sketch at the Islington Arcadia.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Agricultural Hall. A large
        Steam-Circus is revolving with its organ in full blast;
        near it is a "Razzle-Dazzle" Machine, provided with a
        powerful mechanical piano. To the combined strains of these
        instruments, the merrier hearts of Islington are performing
        a desultory dance, which seems to consist chiefly in the
        various couples charging each other with desperate
        gallantry. At the further end of the Hall is a Stage, on
        which a Variety Performance is in progress, and along the
        side of the gallery a Switchback, the rolling thunder of
        which, accompanied by masculine whoops and feminine
        squeaks, is distinctly audible. Near the entrance is a
        painted house-front with two doors, which are being
        pitilessly battered with wooden balls; from time to time a
        well-directed missile touches a spring, one of the doors
        opens, and an idiotic effigy comes blandly goggling and
        sliding down an inclined plane, to be saluted with yells of
        laughter, and ignominiously pushed back into domestic
        privacy. Amidst surroundings thus happily suggesting the
        idyllic and pastoral associations of Arcady, is an
        unpretending booth, the placards on which announce it to be
        the temporary resting-place of the "Far-famed Adepts of
        Thibet," who are there for a much-needed change, after a
        "3500 years' residence in the Desert of Gobi." There is
        also a solemn warning that "it is impossible to spoof a
        Mahatma." In front of this booth, a fair-headed,
        round-faced, and</i> Spectacled Gentleman, <i>in evening
        clothes, and a particularly crumpled shirt-front&mdash;who
        presents a sort of compromise between the Scientific Savant
        and the German Waiter has just locked up his Assistant in a
        wooden pillory, for no obvious reason except to attract a
        crowd. The crowd collects accordingly, and includes a</i>
        Comic Coachman, <i>who, with his Friend&mdash;a tall and
        speechless nonentity&mdash;has evidently come out to enjoy
        himself</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

             </a>"I have here two ordinary clean clay pipes."
    </div>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Spectacled Gentleman</i> (<i>letting the
        Assistant out of the pillory, with the air of a man who
        does not often unbend to these frivolities</i>). Now,
        Gentlemen, I am sure all those whom I see around me have
        heard of those marvellous beings&mdash;the
        Mahatmas&mdash;and how they can travel through space in
        astral bodies, and produce matter out of nothing at all.
        (<i>Here the group endeavour to look as if these facts were
        familiar to them from infancy, while the</i> Comic Coachman
        <i>assumes the intelligent interest of a Pantomime Clown in
        the price of a property fish</i>.) Very well; but perhaps
        some of you may not be aware that at this very moment the
        air all around you is full of ghosts.</p>

        <p><i>The Comic Coachman</i> (<i>affecting extreme
        terror</i>). 'Ere, let me get <i>out</i> o' this! Where's
        my friend?</p>

        <p><i>The Sp. G.</i> I am only telling you the simple
        truth. There is, floating above the head of each one of
        you, the ghostly counterpart of himself; and the ghost of
        anybody who is smoking will be smoking also the ghost of a
        cigar or a pipe.</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> (<i>to his attendant Phantom</i>). 'Ere,
        'and me down one o' your smokes to try, will yer?</p>

        <p><i>The Sp. G.</i> You laugh&mdash;but I am no believer
        in making statements without proof to support them, and I
        shall now proceed to offer you convincing evidence that
        what I say is true. (<i>Movement of startled incredulity in
        group.</i>) I have here two ordinary clean clay pipes.
        (<i>Producing them</i>.) Now, Sir, (<i>to the</i> C.C.)
        will you oblige me by putting your finger in the bowls to
        test whether there is any tobacco there or not?</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> Not <i>me</i>. None o' those games for
        me! Where's my friend?&mdash;it's more in <i>'is</i>
        line!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The Friend, however, remains modestly in the
        background, and, after a little hesitation, a more
        courageous spirit tests the bowls, and pronounces them
        empty.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Sp. G.</i> Very well, I will now smoke the
        spirit-tobacco in these empty pipes. (<i>He puts them both
        in his mouth, and emits a quantity of unmistakable
        smoke</i>.) Now, in case you should imagine this is a
        deception, and I produce the smoke from my throat in some
        manner, will you kindly try my esoteric tobacco, Sir?
        (<i>To a bystander, who, not without obvious misgivings,
        takes a few whiffs and produces smoke, as well as a marked
        impression upon the most sceptical spectators.</i>) Having
        thus proved to you the existence of a Spirit World, allow
        me to inform you that this is nothing to the marvels to be
        seen inside for the small sum of twopence, where I shall
        have the honour of introducing to you Mlle. SCINTILLA, who
        is not only the most extraordinary Scientific Wonder of the
        World, but also the loveliest woman now living!</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> 'Ere, <i>I'm</i> comin' in, I am. I'm on
        to this. Where's my friend? he'll pay for <i>me</i>. He
        promised to take care o' me, and I can't trust myself
        anywhere without 'im.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He enters the Show, followed by the Tall Nonentity,
        and the bulk of the bystanders, who feel that the veil is
        about to be lifted, and that twopence is not an exorbitant
        fee for initiation. Inside is a low Stage, with a roughly
        painted Scene, and a kind of small Cabinet, the interior of
        which is visible and vacant; behind the barrier which,
        separates the Stage from the Audience stands</i> Mlle.
        SCINTILLA, <i>a young lady in a crimson silk blouse and a
        dark skirt, who if not precisely a Modern Helen, is
        distinctly attractive and reassuringly material.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The C.C.</i> Oh, I say, if this is a Mahatma, I
        <i>like</i> 'em!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The Sibyl receives this tribute with a
        smile.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Sp. G.</i> (<i>appearing on the Stage as
        Showman</i>). Now, Ladies and Gentlemen! (<i>There is one
        Lady present, who stands at the side, by way of indicating
        that she declines to give the proceedings any moral support
        whatever.</i>) You all know that Adepts have the power of
        disintegrating material objects and re-integrating them
        when they please. I have here a hollow mask. (<i>He
        exhibits a Pantomime demon head.</i>) I place it upon the
        roof of this cabinet, which as you perceive is empty. I
        raise it&mdash;and underneath you will see materialised a
        wonderful young lady who consists of a head and nothing
        else. (<i>He discovers the head of a very human young
        person with short curly hair.</i>) Now those of you who are
        unmarried would find this young lady an admirable wife for
        a man of small income, for, having no body, she will cost
        him nothing whatever for her food or frocks.</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> (<i>with a touch of cynicism</i>). She'd
        make it up in 'ats and bonnets, though; trust
        <i>'er</i>!</p>

        <p><i>The Showman</i>. She is extremely sweet-tempered;
        and, when she observes a number of good-looking gentlemen
        in the front row, as there are to-night, she will smile
        affectionately at them.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The Head gives a very practical confirmation of this
        assertion, and the Lady in the corner sniffs with strong
        disapproval.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The C.C.</i> 'Ere, I say&mdash;where's my friend? I
        want to take my 'ook out o' this&mdash;the young Lady's 'ed
        is a smilin' at me, and it ain't <i>good</i> enough, yer
        know&mdash;she's left too much of herself at 'ome to suit
        <i>me</i>!</p>

        <p><i>The Showman</i> (<i>after extinguishing the Head,
        which is giggling helplessly, in the Mask</i>). Now this
        other, young Lady, Mlle. SCINTILLA, known to her friends as
        "SPARKS," is equally wonderful in her way. It may surprise
        you when I inform you&mdash;(<i>here he puts his arm
        affectionately round the Sibyl's neck</i>)&mdash;that,
        beautiful as she is, she has never been kissed in her whole
        life!</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> (<i>with chivalrous indignation</i>).
        What? Ere, if <i>that's</i> all!&mdash;</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He intimates, in pantomime, his perfect readiness to
        repair this omission at once.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Showman</i>. This is owing to the fact that she
        is impregnated with electricity to such an extraordinary
        degree, that any contact with her lips will produce a shock
        which would probably prove fatal!</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> Oh, where <i>is</i> that friend o' mine?
        (<i>To the Sibyl</i>.) I come out without my lightnin'
        conductor this evenin', Miss; but I've got a friend
        somewhere in 'ere as 'll be 'appy to represent me.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The Tall Nonentity tries to efface himself, but is
        relieved to find that the Sibyl does not take the offer
        seriously.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Showman</i>. As a proof that I am not speaking
        without foundation, this young lady will allow you to feel
        her hands, when you will at once become aware of the
        electric current. [<i>The Sibyl leans across the barrier,
        and tenders a decidedly pretty palm for public pressure,
        but there is the usual reluctance at first to embrace the
        opportunity. At length a seeker after truth grasps the
        hand, and reports that he "can feel a somethink," whereupon
        his example is followed by the others, including the</i>
        C.C., <i>who, finding the sensation agreeable, pretends to
        be electrified to such an extent that he is unable to let
        go&mdash;which concludes the entertainment.</i></p>

        <p><i>Spectators</i> (<i>departing</i>). She <i>may</i>
        have 'ad one o' them galvanic belts on for all <i>you</i>
        can tell. But, mind yer, there's a lot <i>in</i> it, all
        the same. Look at the way he brought smoke out o' them
        clays!</p>

        <p><i>The C.C.</i> (<i>to his Friend</i>.) That <i>was</i>
        a lark, JIM! But look 'ere&mdash;don't you go tellin' the
        Missus; <i>she</i> ain't on the Me'atmer lay&mdash;not
        <i>much</i>, she ain't!</p>

        <p><i>Pri. Sec.</i> Only half-a-dozen expected, Sir; so I
        thought if I got six that would be enough.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Quite so. And now, my dear fellow, show in

        <p><i>Fussy M.P.</i> (<i>with effusion</i>). My dear Sir,
        this is a great pleasure. I hope I see you well. (<i>Shakes
        the hand of</i> Eminent Statesman <i>with profuse
        cordiality.</i>) And now, if you will allow me, I will
        introduce these Delegates. It would have pleased them
        better if they could have had an Autumn Session, but they
        are quite prepared to be satisfied with an interview, as it
        is in the Recess. (<i>Speaking in the soft tones of the
        House at Westminster.</i>) Sir! My Right Hon. Friend! It is
        my privilege as well as my duty&mdash;a most pleasant
        one&mdash;to introduce what I may aptly declare to be the
        most representative body of men it has ever been my good
        fortune to meet. I, my dear Sir&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Thank you very
        much, but I fancy we can get on better by talking it over
        quietly. It's very hot, so if you don't mind, I will take
        off my coat and sit in my shirt-sleeves.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Now you would like to smoke? Well, my
        Private Secretary will hand round cigars, cigarettes, and
        tobacco. Don't be shy, Consider my house Liberty Hall.
        Well, tell me&mdash;what's it all about?</p>

        <p><i>First Mem. of Dep.</i> (<i>pointing to Fussy
        M.P.</i>) Why he said as how he would do all the
        speaking.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Very likely, and do it (<i>bowing to
        him</i>) very well. But I would far rather that you should
        speak for yourselves. Come let us meet as old friends.
        Now&mdash;what do you want?</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem. of Dep.</i> Why, Sir, if you put it in
        that pleasant way, I may say, payment for hours of labour
        put in by some one else.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Yes, very good. Capital notion. But how
        are you to manage it?</p>

        <p><i>Third Mem. of Dep.</i> (<i>roughly</i>). That's your
        business, and not ours. We tell you what we want, and you
        have to carry out our wishes.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). You mean the wishes of
        your class&mdash;your order?</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem.</i> Well, that's about it. We <i>do</i>
        represent them. Why we are sent to you by over 100,000!</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> And what is the full complement of your
        combined trades?</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem.</i> About nine millions, but that has
        nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> With it! Do with what?</p>

        <p><i>First Mem. of Dep.</i> Why, what we require, Right
        Hon. Sir&mdash;what we require!</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> (<i>amiably</i>). And that is&mdash;?</p>

        <p><i>First Mem. of Dep.</i> (<i>triumphantly</i>). Oh, you
        must tell us that! It is not our place, but
        yours&mdash;see?</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Not exactly. But will you not join me?
        (<i>Offers cigarettes.</i>) And now let us get at the heart
        of the question. Who is to do your work for you?</p>

        <p><i>First Mem. of Dep.</i> (<i>puffing at the
        tobacco</i>). Don't you think that could be done by the
        Government?</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> <i>I</i> don't know. I am delighted to see
        you, because it is with your assistance that I propose
        mastering the details of the matter. But you really must
        help me.</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem. of Dep.</i> (<i>taken aback</i>). But, I
        say, Sir, is this quite fair? We are accustomed to put up
        someone such as he (<i>pointing to the</i> Fussy M.P.), and
        leave it to him to do all the talking.</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Yes, I know the old-fashioned plan; but I
        prefer the new. Pray go on. How will you get your work done
        gratuitously?</p>

        <p><i>Fourth Mem.</i> Oh, come! That's putting it a little
        too strong! We are not accustomed to it. What does it all
        mean?</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> I think I can answer you. My good friends,
        until you can get an idea of what you really want, you can
        do nothing&mdash;nor can I. So now, if you have another
        appointment to keep, please don't let me detain you. All I
        can wish you I do wish you. May you all prosper in your
        undertakings. And now, farewell!</p>

        <p><i>First Mem.</i> Well, Sir, if you won't see us any
        more, good-bye!</p>

        <p><i>Em. S.</i> Good-bye! Mind the steps! Good-bye!

    <h2>INNS AND OUTS.</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">No. I.&mdash;"Mister."</h3>

    <p>In a "Grand Hôtel" again; abroad; never mind which or where;
    have experienced many Inns and many outings, but find all Grand
    Hôtels much the same. "Lawn-tennis, English Church in the
    Spa<i>t</i>ious Grounds, good station for friends of the
    <i>Fisch-Sport</i>."&mdash;But the quintessence of
    Grand-Hotelism is "Mr." in his Bureau.</p>

    <p>The main thing about "Mr." is his frock-coat ("made in
    Germany"). It is always buttoned; he is never without it; I
    believe he sleeps in it. Divest him of this magician's robe (so
    to speak) and he would be powerless.</p>

    <p>The Hôtel omnibus clatters in; "Mr." confronts us, smiling
    and serene, with his two Secretaries of Legation. He
    discriminates the Inn-comers at a glance.&mdash;"Numero 10, 11,
    12, <i>entresol</i>;" for Noah-like Paterfamilias with Caravan;
    "Numero 656, for se Leddy's med;" "Numero 80, for me, the
    <i>soi-disant Habitué</i>;" it's the room I'm <i>supposed</i>
    to have always had, so I pretend to like it. One
    Unremunerative-looking Pedestrian, in knickerbockers, is
    assured that, if he waits half a day or so, he may get an
    attic&mdash;"Back of se house; fine view of se sluice-gate and
    cemetery."&mdash;U.-L.P. expostulates; he has telegraphed for a
    good room; it's <i>too</i> bad.&mdash;"Ver' sawy, but is quite
    complete now, se Hôtel." U.-L.P., furious; "Hang it," &amp;c.
    "Mr." deprecates this ingratitude&mdash;"Ver' sawy, Sor; but if
    you don't like," (with decision), "se whole wide wurrld is open
    to you!" Pedestrian retires, threatening to write to the
    <i>Times</i>. Preposterous! as if the Editor would print
    anything against "Mr."! "Mr.'s" attitude majestic and martyred;
    CASABIANCA in a frock-coat! Bless you! he knows us all, better
    than we know ourselves. He sees the Cook's ticket through the
    U.-L.P.'s Norfolk-jacket.</p>

        </a>"He sees the Cook's ticket through the U.-L.P.'s
        Norfolk-jacket."
    </div>

    <p>When "Mr." is not writing, he is changing money. The
    sheepish Briton stands dumb before this financier, and is
    shorn&mdash;of the exchange, with an oafish fascination at
    "Mr.'s" dexterous manipulation of the <i>rouleaux</i> of gold
    and notes. Nobody dares haggle with "Mr." When he is not
    changing money, he is, as I have said, writing, perhaps his
    Reminiscences. It is "Mr." "What gif you se informations;" and
    <i>what</i> questions! The seasoned Pensionnaire wants to know
    how she can get to that <i>lovely</i> valley where the
    Tiger-lilies grow, without taking a carriage. The British
    Matron, where she can buy rusks, "real English rusks, you
    know." A cantankerous tripper asks "why he never has
    bread-sauce with the nightly chicken." And we all troop to
    "Mr." after breakfast, to beg him to affix postage-stamps to
    our letters, and to demand the precise time when "they will
    reach England;" as if they wouldn't reach at all without
    "Mr.'s" authority. It gives the nervous a sense of security to
    watch "Mr." stamping envelopes. It is a way of beginning the
    day in a Grand Hôtel.</p>

    <p>"Mr." gives you the idea of not wishing to make a profit;
    but he gives you nothing else. You wish to be "<i>en
    pension</i>"&mdash;"Ver' well, Sor, it is seventeen francs (or
    marks) the day;" but you soon discover that your room is extra,
    and that you may not dine "apart;" in a word, you are "Mr.'s"
    bondsman. Then there is the persuasive lady, who perhaps,
    <i>may</i> be stopping a week or more, but her plans are
    undecided&mdash;at any rate six days&mdash;"Will 'Mr.' make a
    reduction?" "Mr." however, continues his manuscript, oh ever so
    long! and smiles; his smile is worse than his bite! I, the
    <i>Habitué</i>, approach "Mr." with a furtive clandestine air,
    and observe cheerily, "I hope to remain here a month."
    "Certainly, Sor; is better you do; will be se same as last
    year; I gif you se same appartement, you see."&mdash;This with
    an air of favour. I thank him profusely&mdash;for nothing. My
    bill turns out to be higher than if I had been overcharged
    separately for everything. "Mr." is the Master of the Arts of
    extras. He does not wish to make a profit; oh no!
    but&mdash;ahem&mdash;he makes it. As for the outsiders who
    straggle in casually for luncheon and want to be sharp with
    "Mr." afterwards, they are soon settled. One who won't be done,
    complains of a prince's ransom for a potato-salad.&mdash;"If
    you haf pertatas, you pay for pertatas."&mdash;TALLEYRAND could
    not have been more unanswerable.</p>

    <p>"Mr." is immense at entertainments; it is "Mr." who
    organises "Se Spanish Consairt," "Se Duetto of se Poor Blinds,"
    and, of course, "Se Bal"; he is very proud of his latest
    acquisition&mdash;the Orchestrion that plays the dinner down.
    To see "Mr." dispatch itinerant minstrels would do our County
    Council good.</p>

    <p>"Mr." knows our compatriots <i>au fond</i>; he makes no
    extra charge for toast at breakfast, and you only pay
    half-a-crown for a pot of George the Third Marmalade, to
    lubricate it withal. Five-o'clock tea comes up at six, just as
    at home. He makes much of Actors, Peers, and Clergymen. Sunday
    is a great day for "Mr." He directs everyone to the English
    Church in "The Grounds"&mdash;(fifteen benches and one tree,
    with a fountain between them); and then goes off to play cards,
    but always in his frock-coat. The "Chaplain" gets his
    breakfast-egg gratis; and a stray Bishop writes, "Nothing can
    exceed the comfort of this Hôtel," in that Doomsday Book of
    Visitors.</p>

    <p>When you depart&mdash;and, abroad, this is generally about
    daybreak&mdash;"Mr." is always on the spot, haughty, as becomes
    a man about to be paid, but considerate; there is a bouquet in
    petticoats for the Entresol&mdash;even, for me, a condescending
    word. "<i>When you see</i> Mr. SHONES <i>in London, you tell
    him next year I make se Gulf-Links.</i>" I don't know who the
    dickens JONES may be, but I snigger. It all springs from that
    miserable fiction of being an <i>Habitué</i>. "<i>Sans
    adieux!</i>" ejaculates "Mr.," who is great at languages; so am
    I, but, somehow, find myself saying "Good-bye" quite naturally.
    <i>À propos</i> of languages, "Mr." is very patient with the
    Ladies who <i>will</i> speak to him in so-called French or
    German, when they say, "<i>Où est le Portier?</i>" or "<i>Es
    ist sehr schön heute</i>," he replies, in the genuine tongue. I
    once overheard a lady discussing the chances of rest and quiet
    in the "Grand Hôtel." "<i>Oui c'est une grande reste</i>." said
    she. It only puzzled "Mr." for a moment. "<i>Parfaitement,
    Madame; c'est ravissant, n'est-ce pas?</i>" and then "Mr." sold
    her the little Hand-book, composed by the Clergyman, on which
    he receives a commission.</p>

        hoardings&mdash;have you anything to do with it?</p>

        <p><i>Managing Director.</i> No, Sir; but we do a very
        large cosmopolitan business of the same sort. Have you
        anything to advertise?</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> Well, yes&mdash;several things. For
        instance, I am bringing out a new sort of Beer. Can you
        recommend me good stations for that?</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> Certainly, Sir. We have contracted for
        the whole of the best positions in the Desert of Sahara. If
        you get out a good poster in Arabic, it should be the means
        of furthering the trade amongst the Arabs.</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> Thanks. Then I have a fresh Pill. What
        about that?</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> Well, Sir, pills (excuse the
        pleasantry) are rather a drug in the market; but I think we
        might try it amongst the Esquimaux. We have some capital
        crossroads in the Arctic Regions, and a really commanding
        position at the North Pole.</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> What can I do with a newly-patented
        Disinfectant?</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> We have the Spire of Cologne Cathedral,
        and both sides of the Bridge of Sighs; in fact, if you like
        to push the sale in Venice, we would offer you the front of
        the Doge's Palace on the most advantageous terms.</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> Then I have an Everlasting Boot.</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> I must confess, Sir, that boots (you
        will excuse the pleasantry) are rather worn out; but
        perhaps the Himalayas (where we have all the summits
        vacant) might suit your purpose.</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> Well, I will give your suggestions my
        best consideration.</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> (<i>anxious to trade</i>). Can't I
        tempt you, Sir, with a million bills or so? We have all the
        best Royal Palaces in Europe, and the most frequented of
        the Indian Temples. There is scarcely a spot of any
        historical interest that we have not secured for our
        hoardings. Just added the Field of Waterloo, the Temple
        Gardens, and site of ancient Carthage to our list. We can
        do it very cheaply for you, Sir, if your order is a large
        one.</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> How about the papers?</p>

        <p><i>Man. Dir.</i> Well, we insert advertisements in them,
        too. Shall we begin with three columns in all the leading
        journals of the world?</p>

        <p><i>Pos. Cus.</i> No, thank you. I think I will commence
        on a somewhat smaller scale. (<i>Gives document.</i>) Here
        is an order for three inches for one insertion on the
        leader-page of the <i>Pimlico Pump</i>.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Lords, Monday, August 15th.</i>&mdash;Lords met
    to-day in charmingly casual way. Since they were last here,
    Government been defeated; the MARKISS out, Mr. G. in, and all
    that means or portends. Not many present, but the MARKISS in
    his place smiling in unaffected joyousness, just as Prince
    ARTHUR did in Commons when the end came.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:33%;">
        <a href="images/94-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/94-2.png"
             alt="'Very odd!'" /></a>"Very odd!"
    </div>

    <p>"Very odd," said PICKERSGILL, pressing his hat to his bosom;
    "it seems nothing amuses the CECILS and their family belongings
    so much as a reverse at the Poll."</p>

    <p>The MARKISS in such exuberant good humour at seeing
    KIMBERLEY opposite to him, could not resist temptation to try
    on little joke. It was not, he said, either desirable or usual
    that he, as outgoing Minister, should say anything on present
    occasion. But perhaps KIMBERLEY would oblige, and would give
    House full exposition of intentions of new Ministry with
    respect to foreign and domestic affairs. KIMBERLEY gravely
    answered, that not yet being Minister of the Crown, nor having
    had opportunity of consulting with his colleagues, he was
    unprepared to make statement on subject.</p>

    <p>In this dilemma DENMAN came to front. "My Lords&mdash;" he
    said. What more he would have uttered is lost to posterity.
    MARKISS had moved adjournment of House, and HALSBURY, who has
    had long practice on this particular wicket, promptly bowled
    DENMAN out, by putting question and declaring it carried.
    DENMAN stood moment looking, more in sorrow than anger, at
    noble Lords hurrying out with unwonted
    agility.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"

        <h3>THE NEW CABINET.</h3>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>

    <p>"They made a mistake," he murmured; "especially HALSBURY.
    All I wanted was to propose vote of thanks to him for the grace
    and dignity with which he has presided over Debates in this
    House, and the manner in which he has, by his dispensation of
    patronage, preserved the highest traditions of his office, and
    even raised its lofty tone. Too late now, too late;" and the
    old gentleman putting his crumpled papers in his pocket, and
    wrapping his soiled pocket-handkerchief round the knob of his
    walking-stick, strode sadly forth.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:15%;">

             alt="'Bless me!'" /></a>"Bless me!"
    </div>

    <p>Perhaps it was sight of this pathetic figure that sobered
    the MARKISS. Anyhow, as we walked out together, found him in
    subdued mood, more fitting the occasion than that assumed when
    addressing House. "All over at last, TOBY," he said; "and I may
    go down to Hatfield, take off my coat, and have a day's, or
    even a week's serene pleasure in my workshop. I'm nobody of any
    account now, <i>ni</i> Premier, <i>ni</i> Foreign Minister. Do
    you remember the lines written by an unknown hand on the ruins
    of Berytus, which TRYPHON, King of Syria, sacked a hundred and
    forty years before the Star rose at Bethlehem? I was thinking
    of them just now, even when I was chaffing
    KIMBERLEY:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Not at all," I said.</p>

    <p>Rather an inadequate remark, I see, when I come to write it
    down. I'd say something better if the MARKISS would repeat the
    lines.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;MARKISS announces Resignation of
    Ministry.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>House of Commons, Thursday.</i>&mdash;House seems to have
    been meeting all day. Began at three o'clock: Sitting suspended
    at half-past; resumed at 4.30; off again till nine; might have
    been continued indefinitely through night, only thunderstorm of
    unparalleled ferocity burst over Metropolis, and put an end to
    further man&oelig;uvring. "Bless me!" tremulously murmured Lord
    SALISBURY's Black Man, as a peal of thunder shook Clock Tower,
    and lighted up House of Lords with lurid flame, "if these are
    home politics, wish I'd stayed in far-off Ind."</p>

    <p>At first gathering in Commons, parties changed sides. "The
    sheep to the right, the goats to the left," as WILLIAM FIELD,
    Esq., M.P., said, daintily crossing the floor.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:16%;">

             Esq., M.P.
    </div>

    <p>This remark does not imply anything rude. Fact is FIELD,
    when at home in Dublin, holds lofty position of President of
    Irish Cattle-Traders' and Stock-Owners' Association. Similes
    from the stockyard come naturally to his lips. Promises to be
    acquisition to Parliamentary life. Is certainly lovely to look
    upon, with his flowing hair, his soft felt hat, the glossy
    black of his necktie contrasting with glossy white of his
    boundless shirt-front. Thought at first he was a poet; rather
    disappointing to find he's only a butcher. Whatever he be, he's
    refreshing to the eye, wearied with monotony of last
    Parliament.</p>

    <p>Writs moved for new Elections consequent on acceptance of
    Office. Lobby seems full of new Whips, whom JACOB grimly eyes.
    CAUSTON with unusually troubled look on manly brow. "What's the
    matter?" I asked. "Afraid you'll be chucked?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, no!" he said; "Southwark's safe enough. But they're
    such doose of fellows down there. Remember at General Election
    one took me neat. After I had made speech to crowded meeting,
    lot of questions put. Answered them all satisfactorily. At last
    one fellow got up, asked me, in voice of thunder, 'Are you, in
    favour of temperance?' Rather ticklish thing that, you know. As
    many against it as for it. Looked all round the room; seemed
    remarkably decent lot; the man who was heckling me a little
    rubicund as to the nose; but that might be indigestion. Anyhow,
    felt unless I could satisfy him, I'd lose his vote. 'Are you in
    favour of temperance?' he roared again. 'Yes, I am;' I said,
    heartily. 'Then I ain't!' he roared back; and stamped his way
    out of the room. That's the sort of fellows they are down at
    Southwark. Never know where you have 'em. Generally turns out
    they have <i>you</i>."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
